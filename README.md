The browser opens automatically and you can preview the blog on your PC.

Even if you run the easy-hugo-preview command many times, only one hugo process will run so do not mind it.

Since the process of hugo running in the PC disappears in 300 seconds,you do not have to worry about killing hugo process.

    M-x easy-hugo-publish

You can publish your blog to the server and the browser opens automatically.

    M-x easy-hugo-article

Display the list of articles you wrote.

## Preparation for useing this package

Install hugo

See https://gohugo.io/

Quickstart Guide

See https://gohugo.io/overview/quickstart/

### Configuration file example

config.toml

	hasCJKLanguage = true
	theme="material-design"
	baseurl = "https://example.com"
	languageCode = "ja"
	title = "PPAP blog"
	MetaDataFormat = "toml"
	paginate = 9
	copyright = "Â© 2017 PPAP blog powered by Hugo"

	[params]
	blogurl = "https://example.com"
	blogdomain = "example.com"
	github = "your github user name"
	twitter = "your twitter user name"
	googleAnalyticsUserID = "UA-************"

	[permalinks]
	post = "/:year/:month/:day/:title/"

### Prepare the server

Let's build with a free trial of "google compute engine" or "amazon ec2".

I created my blog in google compute engine.

Check if rsync is installed on the server.

Write at ~/.ssh/config on your PC

	 Host blogdomain
                        HostName "Your server's IP"
                        User "Your server's ssh login username"

Because blog is generated under /home/blog/ on the server, set it to reference it with nginx.
Ssl uses certbot.

sample nginx.conf

	server {
		listen 80;
		server_name yourdomain;
		return  301 https://yourdomain$request_uri;
		location / {
			root /home/blog;
		index	index.html index.htm;
		}
	}
	server {
		listen 443;
		server_name yourdomain;
		ssl on;
		ssl_certificate      /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain/fullchain.pem;
		ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain/privkey.pem;

	location / {
		root    /home/blog;
	index   index.html index.htm;
		}
	}

Confirm that PATH passes from emacs to go.

For example

	(setenv "GOPATH" "~/go")
	(add-to-list 'exec-path (expand-file-name "~/go/bin"))
